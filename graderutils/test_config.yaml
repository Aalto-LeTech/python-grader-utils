# AssertionError: True is not false : -1 is not a prime number, but your function says it is
#
# If remove_more_sentinel is given, then everything starting from the exception line ending at the sentinel, will also be removed.
#
# e.g. with AssertionError and remove_more_sentinel [remove-stop]:

# AssertionError: True is not false : [remove-stop]-1 is not a prime number, but your function says it is
#
# turns into:
#
# -1 is not a prime number, but your function says it is
